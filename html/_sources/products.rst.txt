Data Products Description
======================================

# Data products and naming conventions

A particular Suzaku observation analysis in the catalog is a set of data products created for \
a particular set of analysis script (aexispipe) setting. Therefore, there can be more than one \
analyses for a particular observation. All data products for analysis reside in one directory \
under the observation directory. The directory name is usually (but not necessarily) a name of \
the region pattern, for example, analysis products for the "pie" regions are placed \
under *<OBSID>/pie* directory.


# File naming convention

The data product files names follow the rules below:

for spectral files -

aeXXXXXXXXXiii_rNR_SSS_rB.pha,

for ancillary response files -

aeXXXXXXXXXiii_rNR_SSS.arf,

for response matrix -

aeXXXXXXXXXiii_SSS_rB.rmf,

for region files -

aeXXXXXXXXXiii_SSS_src.reg,

for region files -

aeXXXXXXXXXiii_SSS_src.img,

where:

    * ae is for Astro-E2, as for the archival files
    * XXXXXXXXX is the 9 digit observation identifier (sequence number)
    * NR is the region identifier, where N is the region number in a set between 0 and 8 
    * R is the region pattern identifier, namely, S - for standard regions, P - for pie regions, A - for annuli, R -for SIMBAD regions.
    * SSS is the source for spectrum. Namely, src - for total spectrum, nxb - for the NXB spectrum, sxb - for the NXB subtracted spectrum.
    * B is rebinning indicator, i.e. a - original spectrum, b- rebinned spectrum.
