Introduction
======================================

The Suzaku SNR Catalog is provides a comprehesive analysis of Suzaku XIS data on
supernova remnant (SNR) sources. An attempt is made to provide a coherent data products 
and analysis for the entire set of Suzaku observations of SNRs. Catalog provides
a web interface to access the data products and the analysis results. The list of 
the detected emission line list is also provided as the HEASARC table, where the
basic line properites are accompanied by additional information on the source, i.e its
type, presence of a pulsar, source coverage, observation region, etc.


The analysis product includes images, spectra and spectral analysis. 
Spectra are modeled as a sum of power law and a set gaussians. 
The results of spectral modeling are provided as table of individual spectral lines.
Currently catalog contains analysis of 615 Suzaku observations of 161 sources. 

Each observation has one or more analysis results, performed 
for a particular region nselction.  An individual page is provided 
for each analysis, which features line list for this analysis
and spectral plots.

In the next two setions we describe the source selection and Suzaku observation 
analysis procedure for the catalog 
in more detail.
