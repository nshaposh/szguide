Source Selection
======================================

The primary source for the catalog object list is  the Green's SNR catalog [1]_,
which includes 294 individual SNR objects. The Green's catalog 
is then  augmented by the LMC and SMC SNRs as provided by the SIMBAD astronomical 
source database [2]_. In addition, the source list contains two sources G023.5+00.1 
(galactic SNR not included in the Green's catalog) and SN 2014J (extragalactic SN).

To construct the SNR lists for LMC and SMC we querried the SIMBAD database
to yeild the SNR sources (otype parameter is set to 'SNR') within the circlular
region centered on coordinates RA=05 23 34.6 DEC=-69 45 22 with radius of 11 
degrees for  the LMC and RA=00 52 38.0, DEC -72 48 01 with radius of 
5.5 degrees for SMC. This procedure yielded 118 and 35 individual 
sources  for SMC and LMC correspondingly.

Therefore, the initial list used for the Suzaku observation selection contained
449 objects. This initial list was then cross-correlated with the Suzaku Master Table [3]_ 
to get the list of object observed by Suzaku. 

The process of the observations selection is described 
in the next section.
