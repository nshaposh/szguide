Data Reduction Procedure
======================================

To extract data products for the catalog we developed an automated analysis pipeline, \
implemented as PERL script aexispipe. The particular analysis procedure is controlled \
by the script parameters. Where appropriate, we give the corresponding analysis options, \
which responsible for a certain analysis setting. We also list the analysis script \
settings in a separate section below. The presented analysis attempts to perform XIS\
data analysis as described in the Suzaku Data Reduction Guide (aka ''ABC Guide''). \
Within this pipeline we have implemented the following analysis steps:

1. Observation sequence data download via FTP and initial reprocessing with the \
Suzaku FTOOL aepipeline.

2. Clean event list production. This step involves filtering out events recorded \
by flickering pixels. Regions, containing information on the flickering pixels \
for particular XIS and CI mode are downloaded from JAXA page at \
http://www.astro.isas.jaxa.jp/suzaku/analysis/xis/nxb_new/ and applied to the \
reprocessed cleaned event files produced at the previous step. \

3. Creating and smoothing  \
XIS image.

4. Generating the spectral extraction regions.5. Extract spectra for X-ray \
source and background regions using xselect.

6. Extract spectra and images of the XIS instrumental background commonly \
referred to as a Non X-ray Background (NXB) using xisnxbgen. NXB event files \
have also flickerring pixels removed using the region filtering. \
For convenience and to speed up analysis we have produced pre-filtered NXB \
event files from the files provided in the calibration database and use these \
prefiltered files during the analysis.

7. Create XIS detector response for the observation and ancillary response \
(ARF) for the set of regions using xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen correspondingly. \
Depending on a particular nature of the source we employ three different \
prescriptions for the ARF calculations, which we refer to as "UNIFORM", \
"POINT" and "IMAGE". In the first ("UNIFORM" source) approach, the source \ 
is assumed to be uniform over the sky. Actual ray-tracing simulations in \
xissimarfgen models the 3×106 input photons coming from the sky region \
extending 20 arc seconds beyond the XIS field of view. In the "POINT" \
prescription, we assume a point source at the specified object sky location \ 
and model 4×105 photons. In the last, i.e. "IMAGE" setting, the actual XIS \
source image is supplied as source configuration and 3×106 are simulated.

8. Produce rebinned spectra and responses using the standard binning \
pattern. Namely, 4096 unbinned channels are rebinned to 2048 channels \
by binning channels between 700 and 2696 with factor of 2 and channels \
between 2696 and 4096 with factor of 4. We perform this step using rbnpha \
and rbnrmf FTOOLs respectively.

9. NXB subtracted spectra are produced by subtracting the source spectra \
and NXB spectra with mathpha FTOOL.
