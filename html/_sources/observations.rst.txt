Observation Selection
======================================

Initial list of observations for the catalog analysis included all the sources
which field of view covered a part of a source either fully or partially.
This was done by searching the entire set Suzaku observations, creating
XIS field of view region and determining if it intersects with any of 
the SNR source regions. This search yielded 615 individual observation sequences.
The set of spectra and images was produced for all SNR observations in this
list. The data reduction procedure and data products are described in the
"Analysis" section.

Further downselection were made to filter out observations irrelevant
for the spectral analysis of the emission lines from SNRs.
Namely, the data from featureless
sources like the Crab or G21.5-0.9, observations dominated by unrelated
sources or observations having strongly variable X-ray background 
with the narrow lines (i. e. the observations near the Galactic Center and 
Galactic Bulge).
